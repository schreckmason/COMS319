  THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXAMPLE IS TO SHOW 
  ONE WAY IN WHICH CLOSUREs CAN BE USED

  NOTE THAT counter is a LOCAL VARIABLE and cannot be modified outside
  the function pointed to by add.

<p>Counting with a hidden variable.</p>

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction1()">Click to inc Counter1</button>

var oper = function () {
    var counter = 100;  // use counter as a private variable in an object
    return function () {

var add = oper();  // two different counters!

// Trying to set counter to 0
counter = 0; // this variable is different that add's counter

function myFunction1(){
    // Trying to set counter to 0
    counter = 0; // This variable is different than add's counter
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Counter1: " + add();
    // The point is that global counter is zero. However, add 
    // operates on the counter in the closure.
